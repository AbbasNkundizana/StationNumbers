Criteria for Station Numbering

i.	The numbering system has adopted a 2 letter_6-digit system
ii.	The first 2 letters (GW) are station identifiers i.e., station monitoring Groundwater levels
iii.	The first digit represents the number of major basins in Uganda i.e., (8_Basins) A more scientific explanation is based on climate zones adopted by the Nile Basin where Uganda(8), Kenya (12), etc. ‘Open for review’
iv.	The second digit represents the order of drainage into the Nile system taken by each of the basins. 
1.	L. Victoria Basin
2.	L. Kyoga Basin
3.	Kyoga Nile Basin
4.	L. Edward Basin
5.	L. Albert Basin
6.	Aswa Basin
7.	Albert Nile Basin
8.	Kidepo Basin
v.	The third digit represents the parameter that is being monitored i.e., literature shows the parameters as follows Surface Water levels_2, Rainfall amounts_3 and in this case Groundwater Levels _4
vi.	The last 3 digits (001) represent the Station Number 

Note: The numbering is pivoted on a valid assumption that the station being numbered is located in one of the 8 major basins of Uganda

E.g., The groundwater monitoring station of Entebbe (GW), in one of the 8 basins (8), is located in the L. Victoria basin (1), is monitoring groundwater levels (4), and has been assigned the number 004

Entebbe (GW_814004)
